          <h3>Rita Lu</h3>

          <h4>Software Developer at Shopify</h4>

          <p>
            Coming from a background in classical music and English literature, a career in tech isn't something I've even considered until the last semester of my second year in university, when I took my very first introductory computer science class on a whim. That was all it took to get me hooked. I immediately transferred into computer science and began going to every Hackathon that would take me where I met a bunch of really capable, motivated people that helped me learn how to code. After I graduated, I began working at Shopify as a Software Developer. When I'm not sitting in front of a computer programming, I'm sitting in front of a computer gaming, playing the piano, reading, or slowly working my way through Montreal's impressive selection of craft breweries.
