        <p class="schedule-item-content-description">Nowadays, software development projects generate a large number of artifacts including source code, developers’ discussions, feature specifications, bug reports, and end-users feed-back, etc. Such data contains rich and significant knowledge about software projects, the quality of software and services as well as the dynamics of software development. Most often, this data is not organized, stored, and presented in a way that is immediately useful to software developers and project managers to support their decisions. To help developers and managers understand their projects, how they evolve, as well as support them during their decision-making process, software analytics — use of analysis, data, and systematic reasoning for making decisions — have been recently emerged as an emerging field of modern data analysis. While analytics solutions demonstrated promising results, there are many challenges left concerned with developing, integrating, adopting analytics into software development processes. I therefore propose a technical session on software Analytics, their challenges, and opportunities.</p>
